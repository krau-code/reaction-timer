Reaction Timer with Vue JS 3 by **The Net Ninja**

This is a duplicate web app of what Shaun did in his tutorial. The code is not mine, I just followed along with the video so I could understand the topic more.

The main purpose of this repository is to be my personal refresher for this topic.

Things that I added/changed:
* Changed the title name
* Changed a bit in the design
* Added a watch-out block, so that the player knows the location of where the block will appear
* Added an error when the player clicked too early
* Added a favicon
